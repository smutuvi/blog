      <description>Measuring poverty remains a herculean task. This is because collection of detailed data on household is expensive and at the same time consuming. Use of machine learning techniques can assist organizations such as world bank and their development partners to predict household&amp;rsquo;s poverty status more accurately and efficiently.Such accurate poverty measures provides a more solid empirical foundation of policy.
Recently the world bank conducted the Poverty-T Tests: Predicting Poverty competition, which was hosted on Driven Data platform, similar to the kaggle competition platform.</description>

      <description>In this blog, I am going to use various R packages mainly from the tidyverse package by Hadley Wickham to analyze tweets from twitter archive of lordMwesh with a view of establishing his tweeting habits. The basis of the blog is a post by Julia Silge. lordMwesh is an ICT policy expert with vast experience in Internet governance.
Twitter archive is a nice large dataset with results that can be interesting and is good enough for those interested in learning R statistical language.</description>
