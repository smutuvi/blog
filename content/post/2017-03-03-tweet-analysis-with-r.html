<p>In this blog, I am going to use various R packages mainly from the tidyverse package by <a href="http://hadley.nz/">Hadley wickham</a> to analyze tweets from <a href="https://twitter.com/lordmwesh">lordmwesh</a> twitter.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/lordmwesh">lordmwesh</a> was generous enough to share his twitter archive comprising over 20K tweets</p>
